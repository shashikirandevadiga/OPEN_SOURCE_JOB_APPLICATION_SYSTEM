# Resume Framework

---

## Core Rules (MANDATORY)

1. **4 sections ONLY:** Summary + Professional Experience + Skills + Education
2. **Exactly 13 bullets:** 3-3-3-2-2 distribution across 5 roles
3. **Every bullet: 240-260 characters** — Verify with `echo "[bullet]" | wc -c`
4. **Every bullet: 6-point framework** — Action, Context, Method, Result, Impact, Business Outcome
5. **Summary: 360-380 characters** — JD keywords frontloaded, NO metrics

---

## Understanding the 6-Point Bullet Framework

Every accomplishment bullet must include 6 elements:

| Point | What It Is | Example |
|-------|-----------|---------|
| **Action** | Strong verb (past tense) | "Led", "Built", "Designed", "Spearheaded" |
| **Context** | Where/what/who (the setup) | "cross-functional team of 8", "payment platform" |
| **Method** | How you did it | "via user research and A/B testing", "through stakeholder interviews" |
| **Result** | Quantified outcome (metric) | "increasing conversion 22%", "reducing time by 40%" |
| **Impact** | Business effect | "improving retention", "scaling to enterprise" |
| **Business Outcome** | Strategic value | "$500K+ ARR generated", "Fortune 500 adoption" |

### **Example Bullet (All 6 Points)**

"**Led** cross-functional discovery for payment reconciliation platform, **facilitating 15+ stakeholder interviews via Jobs-to-be-Done framework**, reducing manual processing time **by 40%**, improving cash flow visibility, and enabling **Fortune 500 clients** to close books 3 days faster."

✅ **Action:** Led
✅ **Context:** payment reconciliation platform
✅ **Method:** via Jobs-to-be-Done framework with 15+ interviews
✅ **Result:** reducing manual processing time by 40%
✅ **Impact:** improving cash flow visibility
✅ **Business Outcome:** enabling Fortune 500 clients

### **Self-Check Before Including a Bullet**

Before adding a bullet to your resume, verify:
- [ ] Does it start with a strong action verb?
- [ ] Is the context clear (what/where/who)?
- [ ] Do I explain HOW I did it?
- [ ] Does it include a specific metric (%, $, time, count)?
- [ ] Does it show business impact?
- [ ] Does it end with strategic value?

If all 6 boxes check ✅, you're ready to go.

**[Category 1]:** [Skill 1, Skill 2, Skill 3...]
**[Category 2]:** [Skill 1, Skill 2, Skill 3...]
**[Category 3]:** [Skill 1, Skill 2, Skill 3...]

## EDUCATION

**[University]** | [Degree], [Field] | GPA: [X.XX] | **[Year] – [Year]**
```

---

## Bullet Selection Strategy

Select from USER_BULLETS.md based on **JD weightage** (not fixed counts):
- JD emphasizes Growth (50%?) → Pick 4-5 growth bullets
- JD emphasizes Analytics (30%?) → Pick 2-3 analytics bullets
- JD emphasizes Leadership (20%?) → Pick 1-2 leadership bullets

**Every bullet MUST:**
- End with business outcome (revenue ↑, cost ↓, efficiency ↑, retention ↑, or scaling enabled)
- Use authentic metrics matching company stage (startup ≠ $2M+ ARR, enterprise = large numbers OK)
- Include unique action verb (no repeats across 13 bullets)

---

## Metric Framework (5 Types — Use for Diversification)

Use varied metric types across all 13 bullets (avoid repeating the same format):

| Type | Definition | Examples |
|------|-----------|----------|
| **TIME** | How much faster, time saved | "45 min → 18 min", "6 days → 2 days", "1,200 hours/year" |
| **VOLUME** | Scale, users, transactions | "500K+ policyholders", "60M+ transactions daily", "30+ workshops" |
| **FREQUENCY** | Recurrence, consistency | "15+ interviews per cycle", "Weekly across 9 markets" |
| **SCOPE** | Geographic reach, teams | "9 international markets", "Fortune 500 in 6 industries" |
| **QUALITY** | Performance, satisfaction | "95% UAT (up from 78%)", "96% retention", "2x accuracy" |

**Rule:** No metric format repeats more than once across 13 bullets.

## Industry Spinning Framework

**Philosophy:** Frame bullets toward target industry using authentic language bridges, NOT fabrication.

**Decision Framework:**
1. Identify core transferable skill (what problem do BOTH contexts solve?)
2. Find language bridge (authentic words connecting the domains)
3. Test defensibility (can you explain this in an interview?)
4. Preserve metrics (keep exact numbers — they're real)
5. Keep business outcome (maintain "so what" statement)

**Examples:**

✅ **Gray area (good):** Healthcare PM → Disaster Recovery PM: "healthcare teams serving vulnerable families" → "teams serving vulnerable populations in high-stakes scenarios"
❌ **Aggressive (bad):** "healthcare teams" → "FEMA emergency response teams"

✅ **Gray area (good):** Data migration → Insurance platforms: "enterprise data platform" → "policy platform serving F500 P&C carriers"
❌ **Aggressive (bad):** "data migration" → "claims processing system"

---

## Skills Section

**Approach:** Extract JD skills, tailor your 3-5 categories to match JD requirements.

**Keep TIER 1 fundamentals (never remove):**
- SQL, ETL, PRD Authoring, Agile/Scrum, Product Vision, Roadmap Planning

**Swap TIER 2 tools if JD mentions alternatives:**
- Tableau ↔ Looker, Power BI, Excel
- Mixpanel ↔ Amplitude, Heap, Google Analytics

**Add 4th category if JD is domain-heavy:**
- If AI-heavy JD → Add "Generative AI" category
- If GTM-heavy JD → Add "Go-to-Market" category
- If FinTech JD → Add "FinTech" category

**Skills section rules:**
- ✅ Only hard skills, tools, frameworks (no soft skills)
- ✅ 3-5 categories, 5-9 skills per category
- ✅ Align with JD required qualifications
