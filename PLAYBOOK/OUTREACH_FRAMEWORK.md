# 📧 **OUTREACH AUTOMATION GUIDE**
**7-Track Outreach System for Maximum Interview Conversion**

*Based on Aakash Gupta's referral methodology + enhanced escalation frameworks*

---

## ⚠️ **CRITICAL: ASSESS TRACK G FIRST (READ THIS BEFORE ANYTHING)**

**Most applications come from Track G (community/event sources). Determine which track applies FIRST to avoid creating unnecessary outreach templates.**

### **Decision Point: How Did You Find This Job?**

❓ **"Where did this job opportunity come from?"**

| **Source** | **Action** | **File to Use** |
|-----------|-----------|-----------------|
| 📧 **Newsletter** (Lenny's, Reforge, Product Hunt, etc.) | **USE TRACK G1 ONLY** | `06_COMMUNITYCONNECT.md` |
| 📱 **LinkedIn Post** (Someone from company shared the role) | **USE TRACK G2 ONLY** | `06_COMMUNITYCONNECT.md` |
| 👥 **LinkedIn Group** (PM communities, alumni groups) | **USE TRACK G3 ONLY** | `06_COMMUNITYCONNECT.md` |
| 🎤 **Networking Event** (Conference, meetup, virtual event) | **USE TRACK G4 ONLY** | `06_COMMUNITYCONNECT.md` |
| 💼 **Job Board/Website** (LinkedIn Jobs, company careers page) | **USE TRACKS A-F** | This file (continue reading below) |

### **Important Notes:**

✅ **If Track G applies (community/event source):**
- **ONLY create Track G** using `06_COMMUNITYCONNECT.md`
- **DO NOT create Tracks A-F** (waste of time and tokens)
- Track G has 30-70% success rate (higher than A-F)
- Track G leverages warm context from shared community

✅ **If Tracks A-F apply (job board/website source):**
- **Skip Track G entirely**
- Create Tracks A-F using this file (see below)
- No community context available

### **How to Indicate Track G When Providing Job Description:**

When pasting a job description, specify:
- ✅ "This is from Lenny's Newsletter - use Track G1"
- ✅ "Found via LinkedIn post by [Name] - use Track G2"
- ✅ "From PM Slack community - use Track G3"
- ✅ "Met at [Event Name] - use Track G4"
- ❌ (If nothing specified, I'll assume Tracks A-F)

---

## 🎯 **SYSTEM OVERVIEW (Tracks A-F Only)**

**Purpose:** Execute systematic outreach to hiring managers, employees, and connections
**Framework:** 6 distinct tracks (A-F) targeting different people with different asks
**Success Rate:** 15-60% response rate depending on track and relationship strength
**Time Investment:** 60-90 minutes for complete 6-track execution
**When to Use:** Job found via LinkedIn Jobs, company website, or other non-community sources

## 🔄 **AAKASH GUPTA'S 3 C'S FRAMEWORK**

**Every message must be:**

### **1. CUSTOMIZED**
- Research the specific person and their role
- Reference their recent work, posts, or achievements
- Mention specific details about the company/product
- No templates - each message uniquely crafted

### **2. COMPELLING** 
- Provide value or genuine interest in their work
- Include relevant achievement that demonstrates capability
- Show how you can contribute to their specific challenges
- Avoid sounding desperate or generic

### **3. CONCISE**
- Keep messages short and scannable
- Get to the point quickly
- Include specific ask with easy next step
- Respect their time with brevity

### **4. MESSAGE LENGTH GUIDELINES**

**Character Count Targets:**
- **Initial outreach (Tier 1):** 600-800 characters (concise, scannable)
- **First escalation (Tier 2):** 400-600 characters (shorter, value-focused)
- **Final follow-up (Tier 3):** 300-500 characters (brief, respectful)

**Why These Lengths?**
- **600-800**: Enough context to demonstrate research without overwhelming
- **400-600**: Reminder of value prop without repeating initial message
- **300-500**: Respectful final touch, acknowledges they may not be interested

**Verification**: Use `echo "[message]" | wc -c` to verify character count before sending.

## 🔄 **ENHANCED ESCALATION FRAMEWORK**

**Every track uses a 3-tier escalation system based on Aakash Gupta's methodology:**

### **TIER 1: SOFT ASK (Initial Contact)**
**When to Use:** First message to anyone  
**Ask Level:** General referral mention, low commitment  

**Language Options:**
- "I would appreciate any referral support you might offer"
- "Would love your guidance on the hiring process"
- "Happy for any insights about the opportunity"

### **TIER 2: MEDIUM ASK (If They Respond Positively)**
**When to Use:** They reply asking for more info or seem engaged  
**Ask Level:** Specific action but manageable commitment  

**Language Options:**
- "Would you be comfortable forwarding my resume to the recruiting team?"
- "Could you mention to recruiting that you know someone interested?"
- "Would you mind sharing my background with the hiring team?"

### **TIER 3: DIRECT ASK (If They're Very Engaged)**
**When to Use:** They ask detailed questions or offer significant help  
**Ask Level:** Asking for advocacy/word with hiring manager  

**Language Options:**
- "Would you be comfortable putting in a word with the hiring manager?"
- "Could you recommend me to the PM hiring team?"
- "Would you be open to advocating for my background with leadership?"
